# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System

Welcome to my very first GitHub repository! 

As a passionate MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Greater Manchester, I set out to build something not just functional—but meaningful. The result? A machine learning-powered **Loan Approval Prediction System** that mirrors real-world financial decision-making processes.

This project began with a simple question:  
**What if we could give banks an intelligent assistant that could make loan decisions fairer, faster, and smarter?**

## ✨ Project Overview

This system uses historical data to predict whether a loan application is likely to be **approved** or **rejected**, based on features such as income, employment, credit history, and more. But I didn’t stop there—I transformed it into an **interactive dashboard** using Streamlit, complete with:

- 🔐 User login and registration
- 🧮 Model selection and evaluation
- 📈 Visual performance metrics
- ✅ Live predictions from sidebar inputs

Whether you're a beginner learning ML or a recruiter evaluating my skills—this project is built to demonstrate **end-to-end AI application development**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Loan officers face hundreds of decisions daily. Manual review can be subjective and time-consuming. This system provides a **data-driven decision support tool** to:
- Reduce default risks
- Improve applicant fairness
- Streamline the loan approval process
